    <h1>blobbi sticker pack</h1>
    <h2>the birth of blobbi</h2>
    <p>blobbi was born on january 31st, 2022 in my brain as a way of reflecting my online personality. he floats around between platforms and lives in my physical house as well. the sticker pack is open for everyones use but we have our own stories behind each sticker! </p>
    <h2>blobbi in the works:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>i sketched different avatar styles
        </li>
        <li>brainstormed how they would interact</li>
        <li>imagined blobs in online spaces</li>
        <li>after rounds of feedback, i simply settled on a sticker pack</li>
        <li>i drew different emotions for my first draft</li>
        <li>then i imagined blobbi in places personal to me</li>
        <li>finally i put blobbi to the test and mocked up a conversation with blobbi in it</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>reminicing blobbi</h2>
    <p>i really enjoyed the outcome, i think it is a really fun set of stickers and if i were to really set blobbi out into the real world, i would make even more. if i had more time, i think i would circle back to some of my old ideas in which blobbi was interacting with online spaces in other aspects. although those ideas are more complex, it could have reached a wider audience and been like a small game. i think the stickers really do reflect me so in that way it was a success. i learned to observe myself and place blobbi in environments that were unique to my life, and surprisingly, it felt like there were so many scenarios i could use! </p>
