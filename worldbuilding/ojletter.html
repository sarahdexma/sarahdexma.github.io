        <br>
        <br>            <a href="https://www.lsiscan.com/o_j__simpson_suicide_letter_.htm">First, everyone understand. I have</a> <a href="https://www.lsiscan.com/o_j__simpson_suicide_letter_.htm">nothing to do</a> with Nicole's murder. I loved her; always have and always will. <a href="https://www.lsiscan.com/o_j__simpson_suicide_letter_.htm">If we had a problem, it's because I loved her so much.</a>
        <br>
        <br>            Recently, we came to the understanding that for <a href="https://www.lsiscan.com/o_j__simpson_suicide_letter_.htm">now we were not right for each other,</a> at least for now. Despite our love, we were different and that's why we <a href="https://www.lsiscan.com/o_j__simpson_suicide_letter_.htm">mutually</a> agreed to go our separate ways.
        <br>
        <br>
        It was tough splitting for a second time, but we both knew it was for the best. Inside, I had no doubt that in the future we would be close friends or more. Unlike what has been written in the press, Nicole and I had a great relationship for most of our lives together. Like all long-term relationships, we had a few downs and ups.
        <br>
        <br>
        I took the heat New Year's 1989 because that's what I was supposed to do. I did not plead no contest for any other reason but to protect our privacy and was advised it would end the press hype.
        <br>
        <br>
        I don't want to belabor knocking the press, but I can't believe what is being said. Most of it is totally made up. I know you have a job to do, but as a last wish, please, please, please, leave my children in peace. Their lives will be tough enough.
        <br>
        <br>
        I want to send my love and thanks to all my friends. I'm sorry I can't name every one of you, especially A.C. Man, thanks for being in my life. The support and friendship I received from so many: Wayne Hughes, Lewis Marks, Frank Olson, Mark Packer, Bender, Bobby Kardashian. I wish we had spent more time together in recent years. My golfing buddies: Hoss, Alan Austin, Mike, Craig, Bender, Wyler, Sandy, Jay, Donnie, thanks for the fun.
        <br>
        <br>
        All my teammates over the years: Reggie, you were the soul of my pro career. Ahmad, I never stopped being proud of you. Marcus, you've got a great lady in Catherine, don't mess it up. Bobby Chandler, thanks for always being there. Skip and Kathy, I love you guys. Without you, I never would have made it through this far.
        <br>
        <br>
        Marguerite, thanks for the early years. We had some fun. Paula, what can I say? You are special. I'm sorry I'm not going to have, we're not going to have, our chance. God brought you to me, I now see. As I leave, you'll be in my thoughts.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think of my life and feel I've done most of the right things. So why do I end up like this? I can't go on. No matter what the outcome, people will look and point. I can't take that. I can't subject my children to that. This way, they can move on and go on with their lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        Please, if I've done anything worthwhile in my life, let my kids live in peace from you, the press.
        <br>
        <br>
        I've had a good life. I'm proud of how I lived. My mama taught me to do unto others. I treated people the way I wanted to be treated. I've always tried to be up and helpful. So why is this happening?
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm sorry for the Goldman family. I know how much it hurts.
        <br>
        <br>
        Nicole and I had a good life together. All this press talk about a rocky relationship was no more that what every long-term relationship experiences. All her friends will confirm that I have been totally loving and understanding of what she's been going through.
        <br>
        <br>
        At times, I have felt like a battered husband or boyfriend, but I loved her; make that clear to everyone. And I would take whatever it took to make it work.
        <br>
        <br>
        Don't feel sorry for me. I've had a great life, great friends. Please think of the real O.J. and not this lost person.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thanks for making my life special. I hope I helped yours.
        <br>
        <br>
        Peace and love, O.J.
