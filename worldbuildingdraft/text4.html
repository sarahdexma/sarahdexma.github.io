        <p>Stuart began his law enforcement career in 1991 as a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy assigned to the Men’s Central Jail. He was 23.
            <br>
            <br>            Shortly after his arrest in June 1994, Simpson was kept in the jail’s security housing unit.
            <br>
            <br>            
            Stuart was stationed in a command center, and oversaw a visiting area reserved for “keep-away” inmates – those inmates who were isolated because of their celebrity or high-profile status.
            <br>
            <br>            One evening that November, the young deputy checked in a visitor to see Simpson: Grier, a former NFL defensive tackle turned Christian minister.
            <br>
            <br>            While Grier and Simpson chatted by phone in a one-man visitation room separated by thick glass, Stuart sat at his desk. His back was to Grier, about three feet away.
            <br>
            <br>            “When it is normal conversation, the glass is pretty thick and you can’t hear anything,” Stuart said. “I went back to monitoring the floor and doing paperwork.”
            <br>
            <br>            Suddenly, he heard the thwacking sound of a phone slamming and then, he said, O.J. shouting:
            <br>
            <br>            “ ‘I didn’t mean to do it! … I’m sorry!’ ”
            <br>
            <br>            “He slams it down and yells at the top of his voice, which is loud enough to go through not only the ceiling but through the glass to Rosey Grier,” said Stuart, now 45.
            <br>
            <br>            Grier, after a second or so, Stuart recalled, shouted:
            <br>
            <br>            “ ‘O.J., you got to come clean. You got to tell somebody.’ ”
            <br>
            <br>            Stuart saw Simpson bury his head in the palms of his cupped hands.
            <br>
            <br>            “(He) was obviously visibly shaken,” Stuart said. “He was crying at the time.”
            <br>
            <br>            He then saw Grier motioning for Simpson to pick the phone back up.
            <br>
            <br>            Stuart wasn’t quite sure what to make of the outburst.
            <br>
            <br>            “It is a pretty ambiguous statement,” Stuart said. “It wasn’t a big deal to me when I heard it.”
            <br>
            <br>            When on a break in the deputy’s dining room, Stuart got called back to his post.
            <br>
            <br>            Supervisors told Stuart that Simpson was cursing him while being escorted back to his cell, ranting about a deputy falsely claiming to hear his confession.
            <br>
            <br>            But because Stuart hadn’t told anybody, he figured Simpson was trying to cover his tracks.</p>
