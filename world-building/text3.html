        <p>Critics of the move slammed it, saying it was a mistake to allow a defendant to control such a demonstration. It was even famously spoofed in an episode of “Seinfeld” after the trial.
            <br>
            <br>            In the years since, there have been other theories given as to why the gloves didn’t appear to fit Simpson.
            <br>
            <br>            At the time, prosecutors didn’t want Simpson to try on the gloves because they said they shrunk from being soaked in blood and frozen and unfrozen multiple times.
            Simpson wore rubber gloves underneath, which is another theory prosecutors have about why the black gloves didn’t fit.
            Darden, during a 2012 panel discussion at Pace Law School in New York City, said Cochran tampered with the glove, tearing the lining in them.
            In an interview for the ESPN documentary on the trial, called “O.J.: Made in America,” Simpson’s former agent, Mike Gilbert, said Simpson couldn’t get the gloves on because he stopped taking arthritis medicine two weeks prior and his hands were swollen as a result.
